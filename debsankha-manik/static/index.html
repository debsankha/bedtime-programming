			I am Debsankha Manik, an undergraduate student majoring in physics at <abbr title="Indian Institute of Science Education and Research">IISER</abbr> Kolkata in West Bengal, India. Besides physics - my primary area of academic interest, I derive pleasure in learning about quite a few of other subjects including mathematics, programming, electronics, literature and history. I am a firm believer in free and open source software, especially GNU/Linux.
			</p>
			<p>
			Various projects I have undertaken so far in the course of my undergraduate study are listed in the <a href='/projects'>Projects</a> page. In case of projects involving programming, the programs can also be found there. Some of the codes can also be found in my svn repository hosted at <a href=''>code.google.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Sometimes when my boredom with the everyday chores reaches a threshold level (or sometimes out of real necessity), I set out to do some arbitrary job (like creating this website) which do not always reach completion. Some of those informal <i>'projects'</i>, if you would call them, find their place of glory in the <a href='/junk'>Junk</a> page.
			</p>
			<p>
			The <a href='/stats'>Stat</a> page displays some stats about either me or this website. The stats are generally updated by me using my IM client or a nautilus action, utilizing the 'Incoming XMPP Messages' service of appengine.
