# of mice	=m
# of cats	=n
rice		=quantity of rice	
s		=size of ith mouse [initial value ~ N(μ,s)]
feeding rate(c)	=b*t
b		~N(μ,s)
ds		=c*dt*e		(E=efficiency)
e		=1/(1+c)**r
sm		=mature size	[~(μ,s)]
dr		=time gap between successive reproduction

size decreases for each reproduction

similar procedure for cats
