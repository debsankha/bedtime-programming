\begin_layout Abstract
In any predator-prey system, the populations of the two species are found
 to be dependent on each other.
 This is a necessary consequence of the predator-prey relationship between
 them.
 But surprisingly, under certain conditions, the population of the two species
 behave like coupled oscillators.
 People have tried to model this kind of oscillatory behaviour mathematically
 by coupled differential equations previously, most notable of them being
 the Lotka-Volterra model.
 Although those models succeed in reproducing the kind of oscillatory pattern,
 when one attempts to interpret those equations physically, some absurdity
 invariably creeps in.
 In this project we took a very simple approach: we settled on a set of
 reasonable rules according which we then let the system evolve in our simulatio
ns.
 The results of our simulation shows that this approach can also produce
 all the outcomes predicted by the Lotka-Volterra model, but without any
 associated logical absurdities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A predator-prey system is a biological system where two species interact:
 one is a predator and the other is its prey.
 Because the predator is completely dependent on the prey for its food,
 the dynamics of the predator and the prey population are closely interrelated:
 a significant decrease in the prey population is inevitably followed by
 a sudden fall in the predator population also.
 On the other hand, when the predator population becomes sufficiently low,
 prey population may recover from the downfall, provided that it hadn't
 become extinct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, it seems reasonable that for certain range of values of the parameter
s affecting the dynamics of the system, the predator and the prey population
 should undergo some kind of oscillation.
 Among the various attempts at modelling this sort of behaviour mathematically,
 one is the Lotka-Volterra model, proposed independently by Alfred J.
 Lotka and Vito Volterra.
 The model says that the prey population (denoted by x) and the predator
 population (denoted by y) will evolve in time according to these two first-orde
r, non-linear, coupled differential equations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{dx}{dt}=x(\alpha-\beta y)\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dt}=-y(\gamma-\delta\beta x)\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta$
\end_inset

 are parameters representing the interaction of the two species.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The problem with the Lotka-Volterra model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lotka-Volterra model, produces the sought after steady state oscillatory
 solutions for suitable values of the parameters.
 For example the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

=0.08, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

=0.0005, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

=0.2 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

=0.4 yields this result:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This graph clearly shows a serious flaw of the model : in each cycle, the
 predator population reaches a very low value but yet recovers.
 In fact, in this case, the minimum value is 0.93: The population consists
 of 
\emph on
less than one 
\emph default
predator at the lowest point! This problem with the Lotka-Volterra model
 is called the 'atto-fox problem'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, this can only mean that the predator population actually is going
 extinct within a cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Our approach : a rule-based stochastic model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid this kind of absurdities, we decided to abandon the coupled differentia
l equation approach altogether because these models totally ignore the discrete
 nature of the population (It is totally absurd to talk about a differential
 increase in a population since any increment of the population size must
 be an integer anyway).
 Besides, it is difficult to get to the physical meaning of those differential
 equations.
 Therefore our plan was to devise a set of simple rules for the change in
 the population dynamics and see how the population develops under our set
 of rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The set of rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The mice (preys) reproduce with a constant time interval between successive
 reproductions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
During a time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle t$
\end_inset

, the number of mice eaten by each cat (predator) is: the total no.
 of mice
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\triangle t$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 a constant (Let's call it catch_rate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After eating a mouse, the mass of the cat increases by: the mass of the
 mouse killed
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

a constant factor (Let's call it efficiency).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A cat reproduces only after it's mass reaches a particular limit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The number of cats dying in a certain time interval is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $tan^{-1}(k\times the\, number\, of\, cats)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

a constant factor (Let's call it extinction_rate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The logic behind the rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first rule basically says that the mice reproduce at a constant rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The second one simply means that the predation rate is proportional to the
 product of the number of the cats and the number of the mice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The third one is pretty self-explanatory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The fourth rule ensures that when the predation rate is high (i.e.
 when there are more mice around), the cats reach the mature mass more quickly
 and hence reproduces more rapidly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The last rule basically states that there is a competion for survival between
 the cats: the 
\begin_inset Formula $tan^{-1}(x)$
\end_inset

 function is there simply to ensure that the competition is less fierce
 when the number of cats is very low so as to avoid the atto-fox problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So our model employs four basic parameters:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The reproduction rate of the mice (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 to 1/(the gap between two successive reproductions)).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The catch_rate defined in rule no.
 2 (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 to the rate at which a cat catches mice).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The efficiency defined in rule no.
 3 (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 to the fraction of the mass assimilated when a cat eats a mouse)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The extinction_rate defined in rule no.
 4 (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 to the rate at which the cat population diminishes)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, depending on the values of these four parameters, the dynamics
 of our system should change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The results of our simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on the values of these parameters, we got any of these four type
 of results:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The predation rate is so high that the mouse population goes extinct
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that case, so does the cat population a little while later:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename dip.eps
	width 65page%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The predation rate is too small
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then of course, the mouse population keeps on increasing exponentially and
 the cat population settles down at some sort of an equillibrium:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename op2.eps
	lyxscale 50
	height 30pheight%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Both the populations reach equillibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from small-scale chance fluctuations, the population sizes don't change
 appreciably:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename eqbm2.eps
	lyxscale 50
	height 30pheight%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Both the populations undergo steady-state oscillation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This behaviour, of course, is what we were primarily looking for in this
 project.
 The most notable features of this oscillatory behaviour that we observed
 are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The peaks of the cat population lags behind the peaks of the mouse population.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename osc2.eps
	lyxscale 50
	width 65page%

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This lag can be understood in this way:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
First, both the populations increase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The increase in mouse population increases the predation (since the predation
 rate is proportional to the product of the number of mice and the number
 of cats).
 Hence, the mouse population comes down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A little while later, when the number of mice drops critically, the cats
 start to die due to starvation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So, the cat population drops as well, but with a little time gap after the
 dip in the mouse population.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The ratio between the peaks of mouse population and the cat population decreases
 with increase in efficiency:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename plot1.eps
	lyxscale 50
	height 25pheight%

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The reason behind this trend is not difficult to understand: as the efficiency
 increases, the cats reproduce faster.
 Hence, the peak of the cat population increases.
 Moreover, the increase in cat population pulls down the peak mouse population.
 As a result, the ratio drops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The time period of the oscillations decrease with increase in the reproduction
 rate of the mice (a):
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename plot2.eps
	lyxscale 50
	height 25pheight%

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This feature of the oscillation is simply due to the fact that when the
 reproduction rate of the mice increases, the mouse population can recover
 more quickly from a dip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this project, we proposed a stochastic rule-based model to understand
 the population dynamics in a predator-prey system.
 By means of a set of simple rules, we managed to simulate the four major
 type of population characteristics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Exponential dieout of both the species.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Exponential boom in the prey population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stability of both the populations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Steady-state oscillation in both the populations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, this being a rule-based model, it is very straightforward
 to interpret the patterns observed in terms of physical parameters.
 Since this model takes into account the discrete nature of the population,
 we avoid the atto-fox problem , which is characteristic of the differential
 equation based models like the lotka-volterra model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Future plans:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In our model, we assumed an infinite food supply for the mice (prey).
 We intend to introduce competition among the mice in future revisions of
 the model.
