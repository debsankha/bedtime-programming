the project I did for LS222 course in the 2nd year. Basically a rule-based model of predator-prey system, inspired by Lotka-Volterra model but avoids the classical 'atto-fox' problem. Tried to create a full-fledged gtk application with pycairo for visual representation but that plan somehow didn't work out. Didn't have time for bugfixing as the end-sem exams were approaching. Will probably try to improve someday.
